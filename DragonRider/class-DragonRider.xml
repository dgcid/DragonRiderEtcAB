		<description>
			<p>Once you received the dragon egg you felt a great well of magic awaken in you. Augementing your martial prowess with ability to cast spells. you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. </p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Any spell list. You learn additional Any cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Dragon Rider table. </p>
			<h5>SPELLBOOK</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing 6 1st-level wizard spells of your choice.</p>
			<h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
			<p>The Dragon Rider table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. </p>
			<p class="indent">You prepare the list of Dragon Rider spells that are available for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of  spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Dragon Rider level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots(Unless you are a Magus). </p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you're a 3rd-level Dragon Rider, you have 2 1st-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st level only from your spellbook. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from  your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and  memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level  for each spell on your list.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Dragon Rider spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Dragon Rider spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. </p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your spells.</p>
			<h5>LEARNING SPELLS OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>Each time you gain a Dragon Rider level, you can add two wizard spells of  your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Dragon Rider table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar). </p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>
				<li>When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>
				<li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.</li>
				<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
				<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>

			<p>At 9th level, you learn to use your wild shape in more precise methods. Channeling your connection beyond the restrictions of a total transformation, you sacrifice one use of your wild shape to more finely manifest a pair of dragon wings from your back in your base form. If you do not already have one or it is not reptilian in nature, you also grow a tail equal to half your height. These wings grant you a flying speed equal to your walking speed. This state retains the duration of a normal Wild Shape until level 14, at which time they last until you dismiss them. At level 18, they can be manifested and dismissed at will.  
			Note: While it shouldn't be necessary to state, you cannot manifest these wings/tail while you are wearing any restrictive garments that would block them.  </p>
